# Cryptomancy-Battleship

Uses a basic implementation of the SRA commutative cypher to implement the basic operations for a fair, peer to peer game of battleship (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>).

The particular implementations of cryptographic primitives used in this software are very likely to have exploitable vulnerabilities.

Should any vulnerabilities be discovered, the goal is to be able to implement generic algorithms that can be patched without api modifications.
